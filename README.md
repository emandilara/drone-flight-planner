# Drone Flight Planner

This is an application that allows its users to create and save flight plans, and browse them.

## Development

The project was developed using the Google Maps API, AngularJS 1.4 and Bootstrap 3. 

## Dependencies

In the directory `static`, please run `npm install`. Then uncomment the corresponding resources (ones in `node_modules`)
in the `index.html` and comment the ones to the external resources (ones in `external_resources` directory).

As an alternative option, instead of installing the dependencies, you can use already the external resources
(JS libraries and CSS stylesheets), that have been downloaded in the `external_resources` directory.

## Run

To run the project, in the directory `static` you can use the `lite-server` by running `npm run dev`,
or another server, e.g. `SimpleHTTPServer` by running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (for Python 2).
